# ⚡ POLY USSD ⚡

### A USSD wallet on the polygon network

#### Hackathon Track: DeFi

##### Region location: KENYA

##### Hacker: Derrick Kachisa

#### Project Description

This project is an effort to bring web3 to 50% of Africans with no access to the Internet. User can be able to save their tokens in Savings spaces and also save in groups via the platform.
On top of this, I have also worked on bringing the utility of ROSCAs commonly known as [Chamas](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chama_(investment)>) in Kenya to Web3. Here users in our community and easily manage their chamas on our platform while growing their credit scores.

I have found out that the “take it or leave it” approach to financial products and pricing has locked out many from enjoying the benefits of current financial trends. Many in the informal sector underutilize financial products due to high learning curves, costs and the commitment involved. While making payments in Kenya is easy, participating in mediums that expose users to **cheap lines of credit and saving pools** still has high friction.

#### Summary

Users can create a wallet via USSD and manage their account through a feature phone. Also with spaces, users can leverage the transparency and security of smart contracts to save together towards their life goals in a very simple and familiar form.

##### Positive outcomes

- Onboarding of the unbanked to web3.
- Credit score and credit worthiness for users.
- Financial resilience through a simple channel.
